  href="https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/" target="_blank">NLP Course
  by the Hugging Face</a>, assuming a good understanding of the core concepts
  of fine-tuning a BERT model described in the
  course</span>.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional
  Encoder Representations from Transformers) models involves adapting a
  pre-trained BERT model to a specific task using a smaller, task-specific
  dataset. Initially, BERT is trained on a large corpus to learn a wide range
  of language representations. When you fine-tune BERT, you start with this
  pre-trained model and continue the training process, but now the model is
  exposed to your specific dataset related to the task at hand. During this
  phase, the pre-trained parameters and the additional task-specific layers
  are adjusted to better align with your specific data. The fine-tuning is
  typically quicker than the initial training, as the model has already
  learned a substantial amount of language understanding. The objective is to
  leverage the generic language model of BERT and refine it to become more
  specialized in the task context, thereby enhancing its performance on that
  particular task while retaining its extensive language understanding
  capabilities.</p><h3>Fine-tuning workflow</h3><p>The provided code in
  <kbd>bert_model_2_training.py</kbd> follows the typical fine-tuning
  workflow:</p><ol>
      <li><p><strong>Load Model</strong>: This step is initiated by loading a
      pre-trained BERT model from the Hugging Face model repository.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Prepare Data</strong>: The dataset must be pre-processed
      to match the format BERT expects, including splitting the dataset into
      training, validation, and test sets, tokenizing the text using the same
      tokenizer (<kbd>BertTokenizer</kbd>, in this case) that was used during
      the BERT pre-training, and formatting the dataset into a structure
      compatible with the model, which involves creating attention masks and
      segment IDs.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Define Task-Specific Head</strong>: A task-specific layer
      or 'head' is added to the BERT model, a neural network structure
      designed to interpret BERT's embeddings for your specific task. We load
      <kbd>BertForSequenceClassification</kbd>, a task-specific head for
      sequence classification, suitable for tasks like binary classification
      or sentiment analysis.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Configure</strong>: Configure the model's
      hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of
      epochs. These three parameters are crucial in BERT model fine-tuning,
      influencing the model's performance and training efficiency.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Train</strong>: During this phase, the BERT model, along
      with the task-specific head, is fine-tuned using the dataset. The
      pre-existing BERT parameters and the parameters of the new head are
      updated to fit the specific NLP task better.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Evaluate and Validate</strong>: We evaluate the model on
      a validation set to assess its performance after training. This step is
      crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well and to adjust
      hyperparameters if needed to avoid issues like overfitting.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Test</strong>: Finally, we use the fine-tuned model to
      make predictions on new unseen data in the test split. Here, we see the
      practical application of our fine-tuned BERT model as it performs the
      NLP task for which it was trained.</p></li>
    </ol><h3>Hyperparameters in BERT Models</h3><p>Three hyperparameters are
  crucial in the fine-tuning process of BERT models, notably the learning
  rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.</p><ol>
      <li><p>The <strong>learning rate</strong> controls the magnitude of
      updates to the model's weights during training, and it is crucial to
      find the balance between rapid convergence (how quickly the model
      reaches a point where it performs well) and the risk of overshooting
      (skipping past the best) optimal solutions. A lower learning rate value
      is often chosen for fine-tuning pre-trained models like BERT to make
      incremental adjustments, thereby avoiding the disruption of the already
      learned representations.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <strong>batch size</strong>, determining the number of
      training examples utilized in one iteration, significantly impacts the
      model's training dynamics. A larger batch size value can lead to faster
      training and smoother convergence due to more stable gradient estimates.
      However, it also increases the computational load and may require a
      proportionate adjustment in the learning rate. Oppositely, a smaller
      batch size, while less computationally intensive, might lead to noisier
      gradient estimates, potentially requiring more epochs to
      converge.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <strong>number of epochs</strong> in the fine-tuning process
      influences how long the model is exposed to the training data. In the
      context of a pre-trained model like BERT, fewer epochs are generally
      required for fine-tuning compared to training from scratch. However, the
      optimal number of epochs is a delicate balance; too few might result in
      underfitting, while too many could lead to overfitting, especially when
      dealing with smaller, task-specific datasets.</p></li>
    </ol><p>In addition to the primary hyperparameters, there are other less
  emphasized hyperparameters in the fine-tuning process of BERT models.</p><ol
      start="4">
      <li><p>The <strong>weight decay</strong> adds a regularization term to
      the loss function by penalizing large weights, encouraging the model to
      maintain simpler, more generalizable features rather than overfitting
      the training data. The careful calibration of weight decay can aid in
      striking a balance between model complexity and its generalization
      ability, which is especially crucial when working with limited or highly
      specific datasets, like our second project in the seminar.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <strong>dropout rate</strong> is used in various layers of
      the BERT model, including the attention mechanisms and the task-specific
      head. Dropout randomly deactivates a subset of neurons during training,
      which helps prevent co-adaptation of features and fosters a more robust
      internal representation of the data. Adjusting the dropout rate can
      significantly impact the model's resilience to overfitting, with higher
      rates often leading to better generalization at the cost of slower
      convergence.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <strong>warmup steps</strong> parameter plays a nuanced role
      in the fine-tuning process. During the initial training phase, the
      learning rate incrementally increases from zero to the pre-set learning
      rate over a number of warmup steps. This gradual increase helps
      stabilize the training process, preventing the model from making
      excessively large weight updates in the early stages, which can
      destabilize a pre-trained model like BERT.</p></li>
    </ol><p>The adjustment of these less discussed hyperparameters, should be
  made in conjunction with primary parameters, demanding a nuanced
  understanding of the model's dynamics and the specific requirements of our
  NLP task. Therefore, it is important to emphasize the use of a tailored and
  iterative approach in setting hyperparameters, aligning them with the
  specific characteristics of the NLP task and the specific dataset at hand to
  optimize the performance of the fine-tuned BERT model.</p><h3>Initial Values
  and Tuning Strategies</h3><p>Detecting subtle linguistic patterns, such as
  classifying political discourses into monologic and dialogic, detecting
  topic shifts in transcribed political discourse, or stance classification in
  political discourse are challenging tasks, and fine-tuning a BERT model to
  capture these nuances requires careful consideration of various factors,
  including hyperparameters. Here are some strategies and hyperparameter
  adjustments that can help your BERT model become more sensitive to subtle
  linguistic patterns:</p><ul>
      <li><p>For <strong>learning rate</strong>, start with a value of
      <kbd>2e-5</kbd>. A lower value can sometimes help the model learn finer
      details by making smaller updates to the weights; however, it's
      important to balance this as too low a rate might lead to slow
      convergence or getting stuck in local minima (a point in the loss value
      where it is lower than in the immediate surrounding area, but it may not
      be the lowest point overall). Experiment with learning rates in the
      lower end of the typical range for BERT (e.g., <kbd>1e-5</kbd> to
      <kbd>3e-5</kbd>).</p></li>

      <li><p>For <strong>batch size</strong>, begin with <kbd>16</kbd> or
      <kbd>32</kbd> and adjust based on the available computational resources.
      A smaller value can lead to a more fine-grained update of weights. It
      might help the model to pick up subtleties in the data, but it can also
      increase training time and variance in training.</p></li>

      <li><p>For the <strong>number of epochs</strong>, start with
      <kbd>3</kbd> epochs. Increasing epochs might lead to better performance
      but also raise the risk of overfitting. Increasing the number of
      training epochs allows the model more opportunity to learn from the
      data. However, be cautious of overfitting. Implement early stopping or
      monitor validation loss to prevent this. In the final presentation, you
      will discuss your early stop strategy.</p></li>

      <li><p>For <strong>warmup steps</strong>, this value is calculated based
      on the size of your training dataset and the batch size. Each step
      corresponds to processing one batch of data, typically, <kbd>10%</kbd>
      of the total number of training steps is a good starting
      point.</p><p>First we calculate the total number of training
      steps:</p><p><math style="color: green"

        </math></p><p>For example, suppose you have a training dataset of
      <kbd>8000</kbd> examples, a batch size of 32, and you plan to train the
      model for <kbd>3</kbd> epochs. The total number of training steps would
      be calculated as follows:</p><math style="color: green"

      <li><p><strong>Weight decay</strong> and <strong>dropout rate</strong>
      are forms of regularization that can prevent overfitting. However, if
      they are too high, they might prevent the model from learning the finer
      details. Adjust these parameters to find a good balance. A common value
      for weight decay is 0.01 while the dropout rate is typically in the
      range of 0.1 to 0.3.</p></li>
    </ul><p>To tune these hyperparameters, monitor performance on a validation
  set using the <strong>training and validation losses</strong>
  visualization.</p><p>Finally, notice that there is no one-size-fits-all set
  of hyperparameters. The optimal configuration can vary depending on the
  specific characteristics of the dataset and the subtleties we are trying to
  capture. Experimentation and validation are key to finding the right
  balance.</p><h3>Additional Considerations</h3><p>In our specific use cases,
  certain types of linguistic structures and patterns are more subtle and thus
  harder to classify, resulting in the need to adjust the <strong>class
  weights</strong> to give more emphasis to these categories –specially when
  dealing with classes that are naturally less frequent but equally important;
  as most of real-world cases. For this purpose, we use the
  <kbd>compute_class_weight</kbd> function from Scikit-learn, which calculates
  the weights for each class to be used in the training process, allowing the
  model to pay more attention to underrepresented classes.</p><p>When you
  train your model, the modified loss function (with class weights) is used in
  the training loop. This ensures that during the backpropagation step, the
  model's parameters are updated taking into account the class weights. It
  helps in balancing the learning process, especially when the distribution of
  classes is skewed. By incorporating class weights in this manner, your model
  is better equipped to handle imbalances in the training data, which can lead
  to more robust and fair performance across different classes.</p><pre><span
        style="color: white">class_weights = compute_class_weight(class_weight="<span
          style="color: #b1fa6d">balanced</span>", classes=np.unique(labels), y=labels)
class_weights = torch.tensor(class_weights, dtype=torch.float).to(device)
</span></pre><p>If computational resources allow, experimenting with larger
  versions of BERT (like <a href="https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased"
  target="_blank">BERT-Large</a>) might help, as they can potentially capture
  more complex patterns in the data.</p><p>Replace these lines:</p><pre># Load BERT model

</pre><h3>Automated Experimentation Approaches</h3><p>Grid search is a
  technique used to systematically work through multiple combinations of
  parameter tunes, cross-validating to determine which tune performs best. In
  the context of fine-tuning BERT models, a grid search involves defining a
  grid of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of
  epochs, and potentially others like dropout rates or weight decay. The grid
  search algorithm then evaluates the model performance for each combination
  of these hyperparameters.</p><p>The primary advantage of grid search is its
  thoroughness. Exploring all possible combinations within the predefined grid
  ensures that the best-performing hyperparameters are not overlooked.
  However, this thoroughness comes at the cost of computational resources and
  time, especially when the grid is large, or the model is complex, as is the
  case with BERT.</p><p>Here a basic implementation of grid search in
  Python:</p><pre style="color: white">import <span style="color: #b1fa6d">itertools</span>

<span style="color: orange">HYPERPARAMETERS_GRID</span> = {
  "learning_rate": <span style="color: cyan">[1.5e-5, 2e-5, 2.5e-5, 3e-5, 3.5e-5]</span>,

}

  DROP_OUT_RATE = <span style="color: cyan">hyperparameters_dict</span>["drop_out_rate"]
  
  <span style="color: gray">(...)</span></pre><p>As an alternative to grid
  search, random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters to
  evaluate. This approach can be more efficient than grid search, especially
  when some hyperparameters are more influential than others. Random search
  allows for a broader search of the hyperparameter space and can often find
  good combinations faster than grid search.</p><p>On the other hand, bayesian
  optimization is a more sophisticated approach that models the performance
  function of hyperparameters and uses this model to select the most promising
  hyperparameters to evaluate in the actual model. This approach is useful
  when dealing with high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as it can more
  efficiently navigate the search space based on the performance of previous
  evaluations.</p><h3>Recommended Literature</h3><ol>
